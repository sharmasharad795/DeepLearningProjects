# DeepLearningProjects
This repo contains some of my earliest deep learning projects along with the recent ones that I keep adding

IMDB_BinaryClassification - Took text data and converted into floating point tensors for binary classification of reviews into positive and negative.
Used two hidden neural layers for this purpose.

HouseRegression - Used two hidden layers along with K fold cross validation to predict house prices (regression using neural nets)

MulticlassClassification_Reuters - Took text data from reuters and converted into floating point tensors for multiclass classification of reuters labels.
Used two hidden layers with a validation set.
